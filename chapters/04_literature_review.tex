\section{Related Field A}

This is an example literature review chapter. Replace this content with your own review of relevant research.

Start by discussing the foundational work in your field. Cite key papers using the \cite{} command, for example: \cite{example_reference_1, example_reference_2}.

\section{Related Field B}

Continue with a discussion of other relevant research areas. Compare and contrast different approaches, highlighting their strengths and limitations.

\section{Research Gap}

After reviewing the existing literature, identify the gap that your research addresses. What limitations exist in current approaches? What opportunities for improvement have not been explored?

This section should naturally lead to your proposed methodology in the next chapter.
