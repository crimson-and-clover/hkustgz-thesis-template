\section{Additional Proofs}

This is an example supplementary chapter. Replace this content with your own supplementary materials.

Include any additional mathematical proofs, derivations, or theoretical analysis that supports your main results but was too detailed for the main text.

\section{Additional Experiments}

Present any additional experimental results that complement those in the main text. This may include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Experiments on additional datasets
    \item Additional ablation studies
    \item Sensitivity analyses
    \item Qualitative results
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation Details}

Provide more detailed implementation information, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete algorithm pseudocode
    \item Detailed network architectures
    \item Hyperparameter settings and their effects
    \item Computational complexity analysis
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}

Discuss any additional limitations of your approach that were not covered in the main text.
